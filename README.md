# tic_tac_toe

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Flutter Tic Tac Toe game, including its architecture, core functionalities, and code structure.

Architecture
The Tic Tac Toe game is built using Flutter, a cross-platform UI toolkit. The core components of the game include:

Game Board: A 3x3 grid representing the playing area.
Game Logic: Handles game state, player turns, win conditions, and draws.
UI: Displays the game board, player turns, and game results.
Core Functionalities
Game Initialization: Creates a new game board and initializes player turns.
Player Input: Handles player taps on the game board.
Game State Management: Tracks the current game state (in progress, player X win, player O win, draw).
Win Condition Checking: Determines if a player has won by checking rows, columns, and diagonals.
Draw Condition Checking: Determines if the game is a draw.
UI Updates: Reflects game state changes on the UI, such as updating the game board and displaying the winner.
Code Structure
The code is organized into the following main components:

main.dart
Entry point of the application.
Creates the main widget tree.
game_board.dart
Defines the game board widget.
Creates a 3x3 grid of cells.
Handles player taps and updates the game state.
game_logic.dart

Manages player turns, win conditions, and draws.
Provides methods to check for wins and draws.
game_state.dart
Defines the game state enum (in progress, player X win, player O win, draw).
Represents the current state of the game.
Usage
To run the Tic Tac Toe game:

Clone the repository.
Run flutter pub get to fetch dependencies.
Run flutter run to start the app on a connected device or emulator.
Additional Features (Optional)
Multiplayer mode: Allow two players to play against each other.
AI opponent: Implement an AI player to play against.
Game difficulty levels: Offer different AI difficulty levels.
Game history: Store and display previous game results.
Customizable board size: Allow players to choose the board size.

None at this time.
Future Improvements
Add more game modes (e.g., time-based, survival).
Improve AI opponent intelligence.
Implement better UI/UX.
